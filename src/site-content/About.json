    "aboutMe": "I am Mariana Costa, a Software Developer from Portugal. I graduated in Pharmaceutical Sciences and worked as Scientific Researcher and as Medical Writer. At some point in time, I figured out that I had to change the direction of my professional career and decided to learn something completely new: how to program. Since then, Iâ€™ve been developing my programming skills, both at work and in my free time. I am particularly interested in Frontend Development and focused in learning more and more about Web and Mobile development, JavaScript and related frameworks/libraries. My goal as a developer is to expand the skills needed to create beautiful projects that also provide a good user experience and are somehow useful. In this personal site, I show some of the projects I have been working on.",
