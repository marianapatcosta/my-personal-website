    "aboutMe": "I am Mariana Costa, a Software Developer from Portugal. I graduated in Pharmaceutical Sciences and worked as Scientific Researcher and as Medical Writer. At some point in time, I figured out that I had to change the direction of my professional career and decided learn something completely new:  how to program. Since then, Iâ€™ve been developing my programming skills both at work and in my free time. I am particularly interested in Frontend Developement and focused in learning more and more about Web and Mobile development and JavaScript and related frameworks/libraries. My goal as a developer is to expand skills to create beautiful projects that also provide a good user experience and are somehow useful. I developed this portfolio to show some of the projects I created.",
